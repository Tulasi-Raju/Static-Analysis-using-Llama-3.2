# Data Visualization - Project 3

## Motivation
Demon Slayer is a widely acclaimed anime series known for its rich characters, emotional depth. Here in this project we are using 61 episodes(total 63)transcripts from 4 seasons to deepen viewer engagement and understanding of the series by transforming the way its story and characters are explored.  Users can interact with the narrative in a more meaningful way, gaining insight into the characters’s next words. The platform allows users to follow the development of individual characters, understand the balance between their inner thoughts and spoken dialogue, and observe how they move through different locations in the story.
